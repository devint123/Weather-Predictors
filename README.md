# Temperature Modeling in Chicago

This project explores how daily meteorological variables â€” such as humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and atmospheric pressure â€” influence daily temperature trends in Chicago.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

The objective is to model and analyze temperature using statistical techniques such as linear regression, with a focus on both general and seasonal patterns. The work supports broader insights into weather dynamics and builds a foundation for future applications like forecasting or anomaly detection.
